# Citibike Trip Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Citibike trip data using Tableau. The goal is to uncover patterns in bike usage, station popularity, and trip durations to provide actionable insights for improving urban bike-sharing systems.

## Features

- **Most Popular End Stations:** Visualizes the most frequently used end stations to identify high-traffic drop-off points.
- **Most Popular Start Stations:** Displays the most popular start stations, highlighting key pickup locations.
- **Average Trip Duration:** Shows the average duration of trips to understand typical travel times.
- **Distribution of Common End Stations on Popular Start Stations:** Maps the distribution of end stations relative to popular start stations to identify usage patterns.
- **Start and Stop Times:** Analyzes and visualizes the start and stop times of trips to uncover trends and peak usage periods.

## Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard integrates all the above features into a cohesive and interactive interface. Users can explore data trends, filter by time periods, and gain insights into bike-sharing patterns.

## Data Source

- **Dataset:** Citibike trip data, including trip start and end stations, durations, and timestamps.
